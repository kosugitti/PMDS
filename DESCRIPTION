Description: This is a port of the MDS program from Akinori Okada and Tadashi 
Imaizumi (1994) PC Multidimensional Scaling Methods, Kyoritsu Shuppan, to the R 
package. This is a very good book, but it is already out of print and 
unavailable. The MDS program that accompanies this book is for the NEC PC9800 
series, which is currently unavailable, and even if it were available, it would 
not be executable. So I thought of porting it to R. Of course, R has excellent 
MDS packages such as `smacof`, so it is generally better to use those.
